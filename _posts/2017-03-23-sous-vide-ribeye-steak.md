I’m happy to share my recent experience of sous-vide cooking a ribeye steak. It looks gorgeous and tastes amazingly delicious. Also, the procedure is fairly easy.

1. Season: A little extra virgin olive oil. Spread the oil evenly with the back of a spoon. Then, add some salt and black pepper. Do it for both sides.

2. Vacuum: Put the seasoned steak together with butter and rosemary (on both sides) in a sous-vide bag. Pull out the air.

3. Bath: Cook at 130 °F for an hour.

After an hour, the steak is evenly cooked.

4. Render: Preheat the skillet. Sear each side for about 30 seconds with medium to high heat.

5. Rest: Don't poke or cut the steak. Just let it rest for about 5 minutes. You want the juice to redistribute evenly inside the steak.

Medium done steak without burning the outside.

The result is more tender than triditionally seared steak. Besides, the flavoring can penetrate deep into the meat during the bath.
