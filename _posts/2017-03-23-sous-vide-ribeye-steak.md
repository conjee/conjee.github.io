excerpt: Sous-vide cooking a delicious ribeye steak in a few steps.
---

I’m happy to share my recent experience of sous-vide cooking a ribeye steak. It looks gorgeous and tastes amazingly delicious. Also, the procedure is fairly easy.

## Season

A little extra virgin olive oil. Spread the oil evenly with the back of a spoon. Then, add some salt and black pepper. Do it for both sides.

## Vacuum

Put the seasoned steak together with some butter and rosemary (on both sides) in a sous-vide bag. Pull out the air.

## Bath

Cook at 130 °F for an hour.

After an hour, the steak is evenly cooked.

## Render

Preheat the skillet. Sear each side for about 30 seconds with medium to high heat.

## Rest

Don't poke or cut the steak. Just let it rest for about 5 minutes. You want the juice to redistribute inside the steak.

Medium done steak without burning the outside:

The result is more tender than traditionally seared steak. Besides, the flavoring can penetrate deep into the meat during the bath.
