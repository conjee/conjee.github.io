I have a Bialetti Venus. It works well except for one problem.

Before I tell you what exactly the problem is, you need to understand how a Moka pot works. The video below explains it.

For more information, see this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot).

The problem is that the pipe of the basket isn't long enough for all the water to be pushed up to upper space of the pot. This results in less coffee extracted and remaining water in the bottom chamber every time I brew coffee.

There should be some remaining water in case you forget to turn off the stove. But I consider the short pipe of this Moka pot a design flaw.

My old Tiamo pot doesn't have this problem. Neither do the classic Bialetti Moka Makers which I have checked in a shopping mall in Singapore. Their pipes are all of the right size.

Go see the real pot if you are going to get one. Make sure it doesn't have any obvious design flaw. A nice pot should also have a heat insulation handle and high-quality valves.
